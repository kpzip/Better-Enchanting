# Enchanting Tweaks

Various tweaks, improvements, and QOL changes to the minecraft enchanting system.
Highly configurable tweaks to the enchanting system include:

- Ability to remove the anvil level limit (The "TOO EXPENSIVE!" text)
- Ability to allow "exclusive" enchantments to be combined (e.x. Infinity & Mending)
- Ability to change the maximum level allowed for enchantments
- Support for enchantments added by other mods
- Enchantment Descriptions \(Hold Shift\)

# Installation & Usage

Place the `.jar` file in your mods folder and launch the game. This should generate a configuration file in 
<br><br>`<Your Minecraft Folder>/config/enchantingtweaks`
<br><br>
Edit the values to your liking, and then save the file and restart minecraft to apply the changes.
